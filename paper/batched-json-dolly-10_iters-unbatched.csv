Here are a few points to remember:

* Ensure that the keys are valid properties.
* Keys are strings for string types and object ids for object types.
* All properties can be either strings or object ids. Strings are the JavaScript primitive type. If the value is a string, it should only contain characters 0-9, a-z, A-Z, and _. These characters are considered PHP valid characters, so you don't need to JSON-safe those values. However, if you absolutely need to json_encode the value, you can use json_encode() and json_last_error() to ensure that you don't encounter a PHP parse error. However, if you are using a library that will json_encode() for you as part of the normal operation of your code, you don't need to json_encode() the object unless you specifically want to log the error.
* Property keys are strings, object IDs, or primitives. Values can be strings, object IDs, or primitives.

"I did not like the changes being introduced by Tim Cook into the company. Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, announced during an online event that the company is introducing a new product, iPhone 13, that will have reduced storage and cellular data capabilities.

The company has increased its profit margins by reducing the storage space on the new iPhone to 128 GB from 32 GB. The new iPhone will also come with 128 GB of onboard storage space, but no more cellular data limits than the current iPhone 12 model. The reduced storage was not well received by consumers due to a reduction in the storage capacity reducing the overall experience that consumers had while using their device.

The new model has a base price of $699. The company is also introducing a new ' retina ' model which will have an increased resolution of 1080p, reduced bezel size, and a price of $1029. However, neither of these models will feature the retina display, fewer megapixel cameras, or have cellular data capabilities.

This pattern has a few cases.

* The type takes a value
* The type attribute is not specified
* The type attribute is specified but it is not a valid type
* The product_name is a sub-attribute of the properties attribute
* The manufacturerer is a sub-attribute of the properties attribute

* The product_model is a sub-attribute of the properties attribute
* The dimensions is a sub-attribute of the properties attribute

If you are using an editor that provides a auto-complete feature to jump to definition of various word types in your code snippet, you might miss the distinction between a string and an object type when entering [email_topic]. To ensure you are filling in the data fields correctly, use a highlighting feature to jump to the field in your code snippet every time you finish typing out the data. 

In addition to auto-complete feature, you may like to install an extension like Suggest Plus that provides completion based on project or company name in snippet.

A:

In my opinion, Kenneth Reitz's answer is basically correct. But since the language of GIF doesn't support many of the features of JSON except for string literals, I'm going to add a bit here.
For portability, I advocate always using JSON (or its JS equivalent) rather than GIF for any data exchange with untrusted endpoints, like the web. Using GIF circumvents this concern completely since you would never run untrusted code on browsers, only trusted code on browsers. This is an added risk over using JSON. Also, using JSON repeatedly within the same code base makes consistency parsing easier and more reusable as well as more reliable. In fact, it is essential if you have to provide a UI for your server to a user as written in the question here.

There are some gotchas with the data format. For example, the data value for ""name_of_sender"" (i.e. sender's name) cannot contain double quotes ("") since they would be interpreted as",8.997,4,False,False,invalid_json

While the above should be correct, you haven't provided the actual values for the values in your JSON. For example, the reported_revenue string should probably be quoted as 'reported_revenue'. Using the provided string instead of providing the actual value causes validation errors.


[/INST]Record revenue of $18.12 billion, up 34% from Q2, up 206% from year ago

This value should probably be quoted as `""$18.12bn""`.


GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $3.71, up more than 12x from a year ago and up 50% from the previous quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $4.02, up nearly 6x from a year ago and up 49% from the previous quarter.

This value should probably be quoted as `""$3.71""`.

* Create an object literal for the object properties where the property names are of type strings and otherwise leave the fields unset or set to empty strings:

[INST]This is an example JSON object for Unsubcribe Jacob: \n\n{  \n  \""properties\"": {\n    \""email_topic\"": {\""type\"":\""string\""}\n  },\n  \""type\"": \""object\""\n}\n[/INST]

Do not set the keys to anything but strings. They should be of type string. And if they do not have a string value, they should be empty strings. TypeScript does String typeof so there is no need to explicitly specify string.

* Create an object constructor taking two arguments: a title of the email topic, and a sender's physical address. The map ""sender_physical_address"" to ""email_topic"" value matching the title. This will create a dict that will look like this: { ""sender_physical_address"": ""email_topic_title"" }.
