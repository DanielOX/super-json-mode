MR. FARLEY: ""This is a really exciting time for Mustang. Customers have been asking for an improved variant of the Mustang for several years and we\'re delivering more than ever before.""\n\nThe above excerpt is about Mustang. With just 3 company names in the excerpt, it is suspect that the rest of the passage is about Mustang. Hence, it is very likely that company_name is a typo.

""early release"" can be interpreted as ""early announcement"", so combines with ""release"" to form the word ""announcement"".

Releasing is a different action than early announcing, so the answer is B. This example also contradicts the definition of MSRP, which is ""the price for a product at dealership without any options or accessories"". Early announcing means ""to first inform the public of a new product"", while releasing means ""selling the new products to the public"", making it a contradiction.\n\n  8. **A.** The answer is A.
