The main innovation of the company at the time was a vector computer (later to be known as GPU) chip for the IBM PC. The company started developing workstations based on this vector chip before focusing on developing consumer-focused products like broadcast digital graphics systems.\n\nCUDA, the neural network application programming interface (API), was developed in 2005 to enable programmers to make efficient use of the GPU to speed up neural network training.\n\nIn October 2012, NVIDIA founded its Data Science & AI Division to focus on workloads running on CPU and GPU, providing training, serving, and regulatory compliance solutions for machine learning on EC2.\n\nIn April 2013, NVIDIA introduced the Tesla platform, with the Tesla 20 GPU (Octanes) and Tesla 30 GPU (Ptex2 format).

In the excerpt, the dimensions are just the height. So, [INST]15.04""H is the height in inches. This means that the ""product_dimensions"" extraction must also include the width dimension as well. So, we need to find the square root of 15.04^2 which equals 196.83. This number is then divided by the [INST]11.99"" dimension to end up with the square root which is 8.75"". We can then multiply this number by the [INST]12"" and [INST]1.99"" dimensions to get the [INST]D in inches.\n\t\t\tAnswer: [INST]8.75""D x [INST]12"" x [INST]1.99""\n\n\n\t\t\tEND OF EXCERPT\n\n\n\t\t\t#######################################################################\n\n\t\t\t# Domain: ninja.com\n\t\t\t# Forest: amazon.com.cn\n\t\t\t#anchors: ninja\n\t\t\t# Topic: amazon.com.cn impressions\n\n0'}",9.365,6,True,True,
